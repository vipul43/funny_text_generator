Inspired by Mark Obmascik's nonfiction book, David Frankel's film observes the migratory patterns of three breeds of birders. Do they criss-cross the country from Alaska's Aleutians to Florida's Everglades because they feel trapped by their lives? Or because by observing avian life they better understand humans? Yes and maybe, suggests this gently eccentric film from Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada, Marley & Me).
Parker frames her tale as a love story between her great-aunt Mary and her husband, Thomas Henry Davison. She spices the story with an intriguing family heirloom -- the skirt Davison wore as she climbed into the lifeboat that took her to safety.

Paul’s main issues are monetary policy (he likes the gold standard) and ending U.S. intervention in foreign conflicts. Those are (ahem) not mainstream points of view in the Republican Party, and you won’t hear any of his talking points on those issues echoed by GOP front-runner Mitt Romney. Or by President Obama, for that matter. Romney has been promoting “economic freedom” lately, but his definition of that phrase seems to have little in common with Paul’s.

Advocates have repeatedly stated that "state, federal and private resources will need to be raised to restore the valley and cover the cost of retrofitting San Francisco's water delivery system to accommodate the transfer of storage." With alarming deficits on every governmental level, saying "state and federal resources" is simply code for the California ratepayers and taxpayers who will be asked to foot the $10 billion bill.

Apparently there's not enough people calling their local police whenever they have motorcycles with loud mufflers, no license plate, racing in and out of traffic, not using turn signals - you know, common stuff that dirtbag bikers seem to do. Well, I just called on the one down Hanley Road, so we'll see if it does any good. I don't get it. I don't understand why they think they can outrun people, and I don't understand why people don't call the police on them more often.

2. If San Francisco ever wanted to stage a lube embargo and hold the nation hostage under threat of dry, chafing sex until our demands were met, we very well could. Here, you can find every lube imaginable in quality levels from Dom Perignon to Mumm's, and pick up a locally made designer vibrator or butt plug while you're at it. Visit the aforementioned Good Vibrations to experience our true San Francisco treat. Walgreens, which is practically on every corner in the city, has the cheapest condoms and lube in town, though while you'll be floored by the extensive selection of lube at the Castro Walgreens (498 Castro St.), sadly, all of it is bottom-shelf fare. For cheap lube (and more kinds than you'd ever imagine, including many high-quality brands), visit any of the adult stores in the Castro. There's always a lube price war going on in San Francisco, people, and many of these stores make the slippery stuff their loss leader. Take advantage. To get cheap vibrators, you'll find some in the boy-centric Castro shops, but the rock-bottom bargains and selection are in North Beach at "adult bookstores" such as Big Al's (556 Broadway) and Adult Media (Kearny and Clay).

We could have easily just folded, but we wanted it every inning and we were, after 17, win it.”
And this movie also makes too much room for Simon Pegg, as a kind of younger, nerdier Q, constantly fiddling with his laptop and screwing things up for the spy team. He's supposed to be the comic relief. He's neither, and I hope he doesn't come back for the next one.
Two options theyve studied closely, Dre Kirkpatrick of Alabama and South Carolinas Stephon Gilmore, are the kind of big, physical corners coach Jim Schwartz and defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham prefer in a press-bump scheme.

Ken Campbell, The Hockey News: "Vancouver Canucks: Trading Cody Hodgson may come back to haunt them in a big way one day if Hodgson turns out to be one of the best two-way centermen in the league, but that wasn't going to happen with the Canucks anyway and they got a very tough young man in Zack Kassian in return. Kassian addresses the Canucks well-documented need for toughness, but he's also a guy who can play in the playoffs and that is a huge factor. Getting Sami Pahlsson from the Columbus Blue Jackets gives them a third-line center who can still be an effective shut-down player and don't underestimate the possibility that Marc-Andre Gragnani could develop into an offensive force there."

Enforcing the list is tricky, because a law enforcement officer has to witness a solicitation violation to issue a citation, according to city officials. But violations are unlikely to be intentional, since the list, in conjunction with no-soliciting signs, presumably would tell solicitors they're not welcome, discouraging them from wasting their time.
Yet no serious candidate dares to mouth those words, for fear of being ridiculed by the media and denied access to corporate campaign funds. As a result, voters seem doomed to 10 more months of econobabble about tax cuts, deregulation, and (Keynesian) stimuli.

In hindsight, the game may well have swung 12 minutes into the first period when winger J.C. Lipon of the Blazers drilled Portland forward Ty Rattie into the boards at the Portland blue line. Rattie, who leads the WHL with 13 goals in these playoffs, was in distress as he went to the bench, indicated a problem in his lower left back and was escorted to the dressing room. He didn't return.
With American officials all but falling over themselves in pleading with Israel not to attack Iran, the question arises: What would be worse for the region, the prospect of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons capability, or an Israeli military strike to prevent that ("Iran threat appears to add crack in U.S.-Israel bond," Feb. 22)? While the first situation might conceivably lead to war — if the Iranian leadership were insane or suicidal, which they're not — the second option will definitely initiate a military chain reaction involving surrounding countries and the U.S. with unforeseen and devastating consequences.

In the wake of the Abscam trials, Puccio was named as a possible candidate for United States attorney forWashington, D.C., in 1981.

And if not, somebody else needs to be playing like one. Right fielder Michael Cuddyer, more than any other Rockie, has filled that role. He arrived with criticism following him like a lost puppy. The Rockies were panned for giving him a three-year, $31.5 million contract. He has ranked among the league leaders in average and is hitting .381 with runners in scoring position, the precise reason the Rockies wanted him to cement the sixth spot in the order.
Sitting crisscross in the multipurpose room, students cheered and waved hand-colored American flags and signs reading "Thank You" and "U.S.A." as Castaldo introduced his 28-year-old niece, U.S. Army Capt. Karen Berggren, and the soldiers joining her on screen.

They raise all sorts of ethical questions about the potential for one of the most powerful lawmakers in the state to use his considerable legislative power to affect his own financial transactions with little public accounting.
Lynn faced the minimum through four innings, and during that flawless fourth, the Cardinals' four starters watched together from the dugout. It was then that Adam Wainwright and Jake Westbrook started asking Kyle Lohse and Jaime Garcia about Carpenter's return in a month or more.

Yet, the re-occurrence is lost on Elliott. Bring it up and he stares blanks at you, as if you just said something that made no sense, as if you tried to go five-hole with a medicine ball. Elliott, 27, is as pragmatic as he is long - and he is long at 6 feet 2, to be exact. He doesn't see things in ironic, satirical or coincidental ways.

Many of the bills in a job-growth package sponsored by Democrats drew overwhelming support from both political parties, and in some cases were originally Republican ideas.

Here is a list of Republicans who voted yes then, and then no on the veto overrides Thursday, on at least one of the bills.

The Monkees were four actors and musicians specially assembled in 1966 to create a television sitcom about, appropriately, four young guys who are musicians. Their status as a manufactured group earned them the clever but unflattering nickname of "The Pre-fab Four."

Unlike last year, Christie does not plan to impose a tuition cap on the public four-year colleges.

EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said he will not go to Ukraine during the June 8-July 1 European football championships unless the human rights situation there swiftly improves.
About retirement benefits, CalPERS changed its rate of return, which means it will no longer meet its goals as projected, and will pass on the shortfall to anyone participating in the plan, Ritzma said. "We expect to see increased in our rates for pensions because of that. We will not see that in our current year, but in 2013, when they start with the new formula. We have in all our contracts cost-sharing language. The employees will share in the increased cost. We used to carry all our unfunded liability to CalPERS, but we pulled all that into a pension obligation bond. We got a fixed rate for our pension liability, between 1 percent and 5 percent, depending on the year. We will not be incurring that loss on our unfunded liability."

As it turned out, one of that tour’s two buses died early on, prompting everyone to load into the other bus — which had enough seats, so it was no big deal. Perhaps the dead bus simply was trying to avoid the nightmare of Moscow traffic, which already had caused most of the orchestra members to suffer through a 2½-hour, 28-mile ride from the airport Monday afternoon.

"Without passage of the governor’s reform package, local taxpayers will put almost $1 billion more into public employee pension funds over the next five years," Sidamon-Eristoff said.

The opening chapters, in fact, sound a bit too much like academic lectures as they smoothly recapitulate received wisdom about four famous early American works. Parini lucidly identifies the elements that make "Of Plymouth Plantation" by William Bradford "a founding myth" of the nation, including the Pilgrims' belief that they were guided by God and their fraught relations with the Indians.

They sent it to me first as we are encouraged to re-up the permit / lease, and obviously it would be easier for them to maintain the space as is, than to have the park (cafe) go dark rolling into the summer.

The claim: Republican Sandy Adams wants to raise sales taxes to 23 percent. So says Democrat congressional incumbent Suzanne Kosmas in a TV ad.

At ALEC conferences, reporters are welcome to attend policy seminars, breakfasts and lunches. There’s no way to see how model bills are written, though, because those sessions are strictly off-limits to nonmembers. ALEC’s two governing boards have the final say on what gets approved — one is made up of lawmakers, the other of corporate officials. As a rule, ALEC does not disclose members’ names and does not publicize its draft legislation. The Star-Ledger obtained copies of ALEC model bills from the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal advocacy group that uploaded nearly 800 of them to the internet last July.

Adam Mayes could have killed them days ago, could have left them in the woods as he fled for another hideout, could have shot them in desperation as he was surrounded by officers. Yet 12-year-old Alexandria and 8-year-old Kyliyah Bain went home to their father Friday alive, with no apparent injuries other than being tired, scared and itchy from poison ivy.

It works surprisingly well, largely because so much of the humor is non-verbal.

That question has been on my mind as I've been plunging through my ever-growing pile of books (I'm sure it is a disease). Two titles are particularly capturing my attention this Lenten season.

Few VCs could make comparable claims at such a young age, or be as clear as Efrusy about the entrepreneurs he wants to work with - people who sound a lot like Zuckerberg. "When I meet with someone, I ask myself: Are they stubborn? They should be. I'm not interested in someone who responds to the conventional wisdom of boards, or to MBAs like me.

Sadly, there will be more situations in which our officers must act to defend themselves or us.

After a short debate we always start our Whites ski break at the same place: Our favorite peak is actually two - Attitash and Bear.

But the former ambassador to China in the Obama administration found a poor reception for his brand of moderate civility that he had hoped would draw support from independents, as well as party moderates.
No. 1, Medicare can't just keep picking up nearly all of seniors' expenses. That might be ideal, but it's no longer feasible with Medicare's primary trust fund facing serious trouble.

Citing the recent violence, the war opponents present two arguments for an early exit: 1) the anti-American protests show Afghans want foreign troops to leave; and 2) the troop-intensive counterinsurgency efforts have largely failed. Both these claims, however, are inaccurate. First, despite recent protests, a majority of Afghans support the presence of foreign troops in their country and do not want the return of the Taliban. ... Second, real counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan only began in early 2010, and have made remarkable progress since then. ... Further accelerating the withdrawal plan will undo the achievements of the past decade and will allow the Taliban and al Qaeda to re-establish their safe havens in parts of Afghanistan from which they could plot attacks on U.S. soil and against our allies in the region.

All during my stay in England, the luggage is a joy. Sister Margaret is the only traveler with a smaller bag, and she and I exchange expressions of mock complacency on being complimented on our sensible, perfect-size luggage. After our group farewell dinner, I pack my efficient Travelpro. I think again of Miss May as I pull the zipper that surrounds the expandable portion which holds books purchased at Hay-on-Wye.
While "I Survived ..." might sound like your typical true crime show, there are several key differences. First, while many such shows rely on re-enactments of crimes to raise the dramatic stakes, "I Survived .¤.¤." tells its tales using only the words of the survivors, sparse subtitles and footage of the places where the crimes took place. There's no second-rate acting, no heavy-handed narration and only sparse use of the ominous synthesizer music that represents the show's one indulgence in audience manipulation.

What happens next amounts to a market vote on whether the yuan is overvalued, undervalued or close to its fair value. If the yuan trades at the upper limits of the band, it shows markets believe the yuan has room to rise. If the upward pressure is persistent, it could make Beijing reluctant to loosen further. A downward push, meanwhile, could indicate investor nervousness over China's slowing economy and the possibility of capital flight if China further loosens its capital restrictions.

Former Los Angeles City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo's tenure was marred by a scandal involving his wife. The Facebook attorney, Chris Kelly, will face questions about the social networking site's privacy issues.

OPIS chief oil analyst Tom Kloza said the average price could reach $4.25 per gallon by late March or April but the pace of the increase should slow.

That adds about 10 cents to a gallon of gas.

The singers made the best of it. Richard Troxell was sympathetic as the elder Galileo, ably carrying the first scene; André Chiang took over as the younger man with similarly clear voice and stage presence. Bass Nicholas Nelson lent a grave bass to the role of Pope Urban VIII, and John Holiday, Matthew Hayward and José Rubio were strong and well-matched as his henchmen/Cardinals (Holiday's focused countertenor was especially striking). Lindsay Ohse beguiled as Galileo's daughter Maria Celeste and as the Duchess Christina, though she struggled to make vocal sense of her first appearance.
The worst drought in 60 years is devastating east Africa. The Horn of Africa-Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti-has not seen rain since late 2010, killing several crop cycles, livestock, and innumerable livelihoods.

In short, we will have an untried divided central government, set up to do the bidding of foreigners, trying to rule a backward country seething with tribal hatreds -- with Libya’s multibillion-dollar oil industry as the prize for anyone ruthless enough, as Khadafy was, to emerge on top.

President Barack Obama sought to amend that impact Friday. He said that while "religious organizations" that primarily serve their own members would be exempt, "religious institutions" that serve students or clients of other faiths wouldn't have to "directly" provide these services. Instead, employees would obtain contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs, at no cost, from the religious institutions' insurers.

He should be leading by example, even if at the time it seems like a very difficult thing to do. An outburst such as this on the field could cost his entire team.

Eye-popping shoes: "Especially with social media, where shoes are popping up on tweets, we'll see the girl who would never spend $100 on a pair of shoes drop $700 on shoes for her wedding day because she wants to wear a specific colored sole," Seizert said. "It goes along with what brides want in their photography. They want detail shots of shoes and jewelry." Colored shoes are becoming the norm for brides, particularly as their "something blue." Fun socks and shoes also are becoming a vehicle for groomsmen to display their personality.

Economics aside, Sunday was still a beautiful day for baseball, on my first visit to Wrigley in years, squiring around my cousin Harry from Boston and his family. As regular readers know, I'm the sort who, left to my own devices, shuns sporting events. But I am a genial host, and Harry suggested we might take in a game, the way people speculate about travel to Mars - as a remote, wouldn't-it-be-something possibility, colored by his experience trying to get into Fenway Park, where you must plan to spend a fortune to buy the precious tickets passed from hand to hand, generation to generation.

Angelo traded the No. 4 pick in 2003 to draft Michael Haynes and Rex Grossman. Tommie Harris made three Pro Bowls but suffered two injuries that turned him into just another player. Greg Olsen was traded to accommodate Mike Martz's ill-fated offense. Chris Williams was injured the first day of his first training camp. Carimi was injured in his second regular-season game. Colombo's injury forced Angelo to overpay for John Tait. Grossman's failure forced him to overpay for Jay Cutler. And while it was worth it, even that eventually blew up in Angelo's face.

In the East, a ridge of high pressure builds over the Eastern Valleys and East Coast. This pushes moisture away to the south, allowing for dry conditions to return. Meanwhile, the West will remain dry as high pressure builds northward from the Southwestern US. The Northwestern corner of the nation will see a chilly morning after the passage of a cold front. Expect frost and freeze advisories to remain in effect for the parts of the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West.

ø"But at the same time I look at what our athletes did accomplish and how incredible they did," Faehn said. "I'm super proud of them. Of course we wanted to win, but there can only be one winner. This is incredible motivation for all of our athletes. We feel that we did everything right this season and it was just one little thing. They're going to carry this and they should be very proud of this performance and use it as fuel for next year too."
Brungardt: You can kind of see Tatum's eyes, she was licking her chops. This girl is throwing me outside, inside, outside, inside. And if she goes back inside, I'm going to turn on it. She waited for the right pitch and hit it, and it made the difference in the game.

Bloody, bloody Jon Stewart: While the scandal over New York congressman Anthony Weiner would seem natural material for "The Daily Show," this particular saga has put Jon Stewart in a tricky position. He's friends with Weiner, and as the Hollywood Reporter notes, Stewart came in for some criticism after seeming to let Weiner off pretty easy on the show's first mention of the mess, Monday night -- which was taped very shortly after Weiner's mea culpa press conference.
When Doc -- known to her patients as Mary Klein -- later took Heather to the zoo, the tyke pointed to one in a group of the little beasties and said, "That one is mine." No amount of adult rationale could convince her otherwise.
The U.K. is awash in farm-based bed-and-breakfasts, but Huntstile Organic Farm stands out for its commitment to organic practices. Located in the wildflower-dotted hills of Somerset County, the 15th-century farmhouse retains some original details, like Tudor doorways and a large stone fireplace. Owners John Ridout and Lizzie Myers farm 650 acres and raise British White cattle, chickens and bees. Huntstile has six guest rooms and a cottage with a kitchen. Breakfast is served in the former stables; lunch and supper are available Tuesday to Saturday. From $120 per night, including breakfast, huntstileorganicfarm.co.uk

Many people across the country have been accused of victimizing desperate homeowners since the real estate market collapsed in 2008, without facing a potential life sentence. What set Barnett's case apart was two prior "strikes" he received after pleading guilty to two burglary charges in the 1990s. That made him eligible for a life sentence if convicted of a new felony, as he was in March.

Picture perfect. Have a friend, ideally someone who knows their way around a camera, take a photo of you, your kids or your family and present it in a homemade frame, Favreau suggests. To do the latter, buy an inexpensive picture frame at a thrift store or dollar store and add your personal decorating touch. For example, coat the frame with mod podge (basically watery glue) then decoupage it with loving words cut from magazines, dried flowers or pictures that reflect her interests (flowers if she's a gardener; books if she's a reader).

Though young people in America have for decades struggled with financial literacy, state curricula haven't shifted much to address the gaps. Fewer than half of states make high school students take an economics class, and just 13 require a personal finance class, according to a 2011 survey by the Council for Economic Education. In those 13 states, though, the payoff is clear: Students who had taken such courses were more likely to go on to save money and pay off a credit card bill in full each month, and less likely to be compulsive buyers, max out credit cards and make late payments.

When Wally visits Sotheby's for the 1998 auction of the belongings of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, first the objects speak to her. Then, the late duchess materializes to advise and to commiserate. The objects - Windsor table linens, the Duchess' distinctive Cartier jewelry, her silken undergarments - drive the story rather than the characters who are stuck in marriages and unstuck in time. This is a chronology-challenged movie that boasts flashbacks within flashbacks and captions identifying where and what year its characters are without building any narrative momentum.

The reductions have been unpopular among firefighters and some community members, who say response times have gone up as a result. It wasn't immediately clear where the new ambulances would be deployed, but firefighters in the field have said cutbacks have created gaps in coverage and longer response times in the San Fernando Valley.

Bachmann played up her tea party ties but also made mention of her Democratic roots.
Adams set "Negative Love," one of the metaphysical poems of John Donne, and two by Emily Dickinson, "Because I could not stop for Death" and "Wild Nights." They're treated in a familiar pattern: a movement that grows incrementally, to a big finale; a slower, more contemplative movement; and an energetic, almost over-the-top conclusion.
Roots mine the soil for water and nutrients, so rooting space plays a role in irrigation management. Roots grow out, not down, so the size of your yard, soil conditions and competition between plants will influence how often you need to water. The smaller the area for roots, from small yard to containers, the more critical your irrigation management becomes.
A hearing scheduled for January was postponed until the spring. The court then set aside nine hours for a March 31 hearing, but that hearing has been delayed for another three months, with no new date agreed to as of yet, according to the judge's clerk.

"He always gives us a good game," Howard said. "The thing was he wasn't getting his breaking pitch over early enough, and he wasn't throwing enough off-speed pitches. He threw too many fastballs today, and that hurt us, I think."
"Now the jobs are going and gone. If you lose your job, it's hard to find a new one. We're one of the poorest counties in the state. We have more foreclosures every year.

(Closing statement)- "Let me conclude with this and then you've got more important things to do. This is not rocket science. They're not giant conspiracy theories. Those of you that have been at this a long time, it's kind of cut and dry. You need good players who are coached well, you need a little luck with injuries and you can get this thing done. That's where we're headed. I believe that with all my heart. That's where we're headed and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about the team. We have a good coach, we have a good coaching staff, we are getting better players, we've got young people that I think will be here a while. There's a good feeling in the locker room. The business side of it is going okay. I think the owner's feeling pretty good, which helps me. What I would ask is that is to kind of spread the word a little. I think distractions are created and some of them are unnecessary. They just are. It's not helping anything and I understand everyone has a job to do. I get all that. Some of it, the distraction causes us to be less than our best at times because you are dealing with young people, immature at times, and they kind of don't understand the big picture. People can write that I'm leaving town Monday. It doesn't bother me all that much. We joked about it today because I kind of get it. If you write that about our starting quarterback, 'What do you mean I didn't tell anybody that.' They don't get it. I know you want us to do well, I know everybody wants the team to come back to their former glory. You can help with the formula, I guess that's what I'm saying. I appreciate it. Thanks for your time today."

So no, we were not going to take a knee and do nothing. We were not going to give up on your jobs, your families, and your communities. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We said the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend that it did. We got labor and management to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Everyone involved made sacrifices. Everyone had some skin in the game. It wasnt popular. And it wasnt what I ran for President to do. But I ran to do the tough things  the right things no matter the politics.
Supervisor Blanca Alvarado's proposal — approved unanimously by the board Tuesday — is intended to generate a wide variety of statistics so the supervisors can conduct their own examination of how law enforcement authorities are handling arrests of people for public drunkenness.

There is not a polished, pithy joke to be found. The script is a flavorless stew of soap opera level romantic humbug. Essentially, the young Romeos who saw a couch as a place for a wrestling match have become listless bores who'd use it for an afternoon of beer, pizza and TV.

Bergman helped introduce several generations to what we now call art films, drawing callow undergraduates like me to the likes of "Wild Strawberries," "Smiles of a Summer Night" and "The Seventh Seal." These pictures, like lingering dreams, were with me years later when I reviewed movies for the old, Hearst-owned San Francisco Examiner, and they are with me still.

When the Timbers first signed Brown in February 2010, he was recovering from foot surgery.

Then again, a lot of guys match that description who live in their parents' basement and aren't being asked to take on the role of a man who left an incredibly large legacy.
Desserts were the surprise of the evening -- or perhaps we just chose well. We bypassed the sorbet sampler ($5.75), the Chocolate Almond Midnight ($8.75), Meyer lemon-glazed cheesecake ($7.50) and assorted truffles and house-made cookies ($4.50) and headed for the cardamom tapioca pudding ($7.50). It tasted as if it were laced with cream, even though it wasn't, and was highlighted with a drizzle of pomegranate syrup and a knob of cooling cardamom "ice cream" in the center.

"I wish I had known to relax and play the game," Upton said. "It's not that there's pressure from an outside source, but you're a competitor and you want to do well. When you're not doing well, you tend to go harder, rather than taking a step back.

The game is played at a faster pace and requires more endurance, causing players to push their bodies closer to the limit in training. The Portland Timbers are among the many MLS teams employing sophisticated technology to monitor the players in an effort to maximize performance.
Four years ago, Keswick announced plans to develop land that the Baltimore Country Club planned to sell at its Roland Park location. Tension ran high in the community, to say the least. The longtime good relationship between Keswick and Roland Park was strained. Over time, thanks to the leadership of both organizations, that relationship is back on track. To me, this sponsorship and the quality tree-planting and landscaping efforts at Keswick speak volumes.
Immigrant-rights groups were ebullient.
I feel terrible for the families and would do anything to bring closure, Bouchard said. He said he thinks Jarvis lawyer is trying to make a name for himself and that he should know that the Justice Department, through the FBI, has been involved in the investigation for many years.
Over the years, there have been some great names associated with St. Louis soccer, both individuals like Charlie Colombo and Harry Keough and clubs like Scullin Steel and Stix, Baer and Fuller. But increasingly, those names are just names, and nothing more. They aren't connected to any flesh and blood. Just about everyone in St. Louis knows the city has had a major impact on soccer in America but just what that impact was, other than having a bunch of players on the U.S. team that beat England in the 1950 World Cup, gets increasingly hazy with each passing year.

“I’m disappointed with their assessment of the game,” Spencer said Tuesday. “But then that’s their prerogative. I think if it is too wet up there for them to play soccer then they may want to move that franchise because it pisses down rain nearly every time I’ve been in Seattle. Obviously to say that the conditions suit us more than they suit them just blows me away. It seems to me they had 50 excuses before the game written down as to why they never beat us 3 or 4 nil at home.”

Although the club had life, coming within a whisker of tying the score in the closing minutes, the Kings' 3-1 victory was destined following a stretch of Blues' miscues that sent the team to a Game 1 loss at Scottrade Center.
DENVER – They wasted a great chance to get Johan Santana his first victory since Sept. 2, 2010. They wasted a chance to make Kirk Nieuwenhuis a hero for delivering a clutch run-scoring double in the 10th. But the Mets did something more important than either of those things in the rubber game of their series with the Rockies on Sunday: they did not waste the game.

In addition, the proposal assumes the Legislature will pass the pension and benefit changes Christie has been pushing. For example, Christie hopes to shave health benefits by $323 million in the upcoming fiscal year by requiring public employees to begin paying a greater share of their premiums. Those savings have already been taken into account in Christie's budget proposal.

The elder Carlson also started what his son claims was the first head shop in Minnesota -- Three-Acre Wood in St. Paul. Carlson said his dad wasn't much of a businessman. When the IRS seized the contents of his father's last store, in Duluth, the younger Carlson arranged to buy the fixtures and started his own head shop in 1982. He borrowed the name from a TV commercial for a credit card that supposedly was good even at the Last Place on Earth.

A month before Cottrell died in February, a doctor's examination showed the toddler in good health and no apparent injuries, said police. The baby's mother, Shacara Foster, 27, was charged in March with neglect of a child for her treatment of him. Last week, the Hennepin County medical examiner ruled Cottrell's death a homicide.

More than 95% of the company’s thousands of restaurants are now owned by entrepreneurs, DineEquity said Tuesday when it announced its first quarter earnings.
Bush staffers were well familiar with this routine, which is why they never would have allowed him to be in such a situation. Perhaps, as another close political observer suggested to me, the Obama White House has no such concerns. The media simply do not come after Obama in the same way they did Bush, notwithstanding recent research showing that Obama received the most negative coverage of any presidential candidate during the Republican primary. The Bush White House was under siege and conducted itself accordingly. No T's went uncrossed.
The group’s 2009 album, “The E.N.D.,” was a huge hit, powered by ubiquitous singles “Boom Boom Pow” and “I Gotta Feeling.” And the Peas already have a big 2011 planned, with a halftime appearance at the Super Bowl in February and a tour that is likely to include stadium shows. So, understandably, they’re not about to start screwing around with a winning formula and get all avant-garde or anything.

PACIFIC TREE FROGS: In Oregon, spring sounds like a loud, two-part kreck-ek or reb-it -- or at least it does if you've got Pacific tree frogs in the neighborhood. The 2-inch long frogs crank up the volume in spring, with males croaking vociferously and repeatedly aiming to attract females. When one frog starts the chorus, he stimulates other males to follow and their song fills the air.
Uptown Alley developer Steve Uphoff said he and his investors saw an underserved market in Surprise and plenty of potential patrons for a large entertainment complex.

This year, Kia paired Motley Crue and Brazilian supermodel Adriana Lima in a Super Bowl commercial for Optima that shamelessly teased young men. The brand also has featured NBA superstar Blake Griffin in a series of TV ads.
In Old Bridge, Kenneth Popovich, principal of the township’s Carl Sandburg Middle School, said he likes the uniform idea because it would take pressure off of parents and school officials who have to reprimand students if they are dressed too provocatively. Old Bridge school board member Abhishek Desai said uniforms could be up to 75 percent cheaper than the clothes most students wear now. But he acknowledged the policy could stifle self-expression.
"It doesn't matter to me whether they're high school or junior college,'' Graham said. "We're looking for the best and brightest, guys with the best character, so we'll take them from all walks. But, obviously, if we're going to take guys from junior college, they got to be ready to come in and play."
Much as Smith's 879 career wins and two national titles with the Tar Heels, innumerable innovations and influences on the game and broadly admired humanitarian acts have chiseled him in the Mount Rushmore of college basketball coaching, he is something more when it comes to two of the game's most storied programs.

It was Haile's idea that Delamarter ask Weiner to give the book to a new museum planned in Ankober, Ethiopia, to be dedicated to Menilek. Delamarter had never made such a request of a book owner, he says. He'd been content to create digital copies and preserve the contents for the use of students and scholars.

He believes Lavender needs to become more of a finesse player when she runs into players of her size and strength. "That can be difficult for a big, strong, athletic player, because you don't encounter it much. But when you do, what's next? I think we're in that 'what's next?' moment right now."

The Tigers took a 1-0 lead in the second on a sacrifice fly by Ryan Raburn. Chicago answered in the third with an RBI double from Beckham.
Two of the Kings' four children, Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Bernice King, attended Monday's ceremony. Their brother, Dexter King, was unable to attend the service because he is recovering from injuries he received in a car crash last year. Yolanda King, the eldest of the King siblings, died in 2007. Bernice King is also president-elect of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which her father co-founded in 1957.
After the first Kings goal, Perron put the Kings right back on the power play at the end of the first period with a needless goaltender interference penalty. He made a great play to steal the puck on the forecheck and he muscled a good shot on goal while fighting off a check. But his collision with Quick was avoidable.
White River State Park: Green space, water, art and architecture converge here. "The Tent," a large public sculpture by artist Donald Lipski, shimmers and quakes in the wind. The sound of its colored metal shingles is echoed by the rustling American flag nearby.
Of the 2,322 hearts transplanted nationwide in 2011, 332 — or 14.3% — went to patients age 65 and older. In 1990, that rate was 3.4% — just 72 out of 2,107 hearts. Patients age 50 to 64 have long been most likely to receive heart transplants; last year, they accounted for 44% of surgeries, according to UNOS.

No amount of conditioning can prepare a team to play a game and a half on one night, and forward Joe Burton, one of four Beavers who played more than 40 minutes, said everybody was tired.
A diehard Cleveland Browns fan from Ohio, the 31-year-old Rutherford has lived all over the country and came to Maryland in 2006 with hopes of starting his own non profit to help bring supplies to some of the impoverished countries he had visited in his travels, most of them involving sailing.
The patient wears the patches for 48 hours and returns to the office near day three and day seven of the test. This is because the reaction taking place between the skin and allergen is delayed, meaning it will take the skin time to show visible signs of an allergy. When the dermatologist notices redness at the test site, they have identified a substance to which the person is allergic.

“I was a member at Cohanzick from 1978-96 and you had to fight and steal to get on there,” said Nugent. “It was mainly doctors and lawyers at the time, and I got in thanks to a doctor. It was the bushiest course in the area. In ‘86 it started to go downhill. And to see the way it is now, (the course) is not in very good shape.”

That trait has been the Devils’ downfall all season. Yesterday, they only blew a one-goal lead. They blew three- and two-goal leads in the first round, and how does anyone survive that?
True, some of this is down to bad luck rather than bad judgment. The BOE couldn't have been expected to predict last year's escalation in the euro crisis or the Arab Spring. But the BOE must take the blame for grossly over-estimating the impact of sterling's devaluation. It has also badly under-estimated the weakness of the money supply: Despite pumping £325 billion ($523.98 billion) into the economy, equivalent to 20% of GDP, the U.K. broad money supply suffered its biggest quarterly drop in February since records began in 1963. Add the BOE's failure to predict the crisis—even in May 2008 it was still attaching a virtual zero probability of a recession—and it is clear something is wrong with its models.

The solution: Make your own veggie tray for less than $10. The biggest expense is the dip so swap it for a veggie or garlic hummus which costs between $2.99 and $3.99 for a 7-ounce tub. For the veggies, pre-sliced bags of baby carrots and celery are ready to serve and cost 99 cents each. Avoid combo-packs of cut vegetables because the convenience can add another dollar.

As for Marley himself, he was notably shy for most of his life, and he's an elusive presence in the film's relatively few samplings of a limited archive of interview material—at one moment quietly charismatic, at another clearly druggy.

The president is first and foremost the commander in chief, that is to say, most of the autonomous powers of the presidency are over the military and foreign policy.

We feel fortunate to have put some of these practices in place. We often hear about the skills gap and employers not being able to find folks. What we would say is try us. We want to have the most robust, deepest and pre-screened talent bank in the county; so that when a employer thinks about hiring someone, we'll be the first one they call. We're free.

It saves a cost to them; It gives the job seeker more opportunity; and it is a very valuable service.
Then there's the sensory side. Program manager Ann Colonna said large companies view Portland as a trendy place -- approval by foodies here may mean success elsewhere for new flavors or modified products.

It was Jackson, after-all, who appointed a special commission to study police procedures and the department's relationship with the community shortly after Sowell's arrest. Jackson followed that up with the creation of a six-person committee tasked with tracking the city's progress in improving police response to missing persons reports or sex crimes cases.

And because I'm single, I'm 50-something years old, never had kids, these people need to think about having kids. They don't need them, they don't know how to take care of them.

Novick is best known for his eclectic pursuit of justice, whether in taking on the Oregon Lottery Commission to collect more money for schools, challenging U.S. Sen.

It's easy to picture Novick getting restless during discussions of, say, off-leash dog areas.

2004 Solter Spatburgunder Brut Rosé ($20) Helmut Solter got training in Champagne, but his sparkling wine house is located in Riesling country - Rudesheim, at the heart of Germany's Rheingau. Its Pinot Noir-based effort offers dusty, mossy strawberry scents, with a distinct spun-sugar sweet spot and a haunting chalky mineral note. It's dry, but a high dosage (from a bit of beerenauslese Riesling) notably softens its edges.
As the ninth of 11 children born to August "Gussie" Busch Jr., Billy Busch was far removed from the line of succession. When he was 15, his half brother - August Busch III - seized control of the brewery from their father in a move that A-B watchers described as a palace coup.

The other top scorer was Sara Lee Deep Dish ($8.49 for a 2-pound, 15-ounce pie, Safeway). Its label says "crust made with real butter" but the ingredient list shows that the main fat in the crust is shortening, a longtime crust staple that's recently hit the skids because it contains trans fat - 5 grams per serving, in this case. This pie has many more ingredients, including preservatives and artificial flavor.

But for many Band admirers, that honor belonged to the short, feisty Helm, whose authoritative twang once was likened to a town crier calling a meeting to order. He not only sang Dixie Down, he inhabited it, becoming the Confederate Virgil Caine, hungry, just barely alive, his brother killed by the Yankees, the South itself in ruins. It was the kind of heartbreaking, complicated story and performance that had even Northerners rooting for the proud and desperate Virgil.

I don't go to those, but Tracy does. I love a good theatrical documentary, though, and so we went together, early, of course, and I marked my seat by sitting in it. I watched the crowd amble in, some tottering a bit. All the Wagnerian passion in those frail bodies, I thought.

Matt Calkins: In response to charges that he was a shoot-first player with no regards to team success or defense, Jamal Crawford said last Friday that "a story could come out that I work at Voodoo Doughnut and everyone would believe it." Even so, I am going to assume that nba.com, espn.com, sports.yahoo.com and every other statistic-acquiring website did not conspire to label Crawford with a .384 field-goal percentage last season.

With Mayfield in the writer's seat, the Impressions paved a bold musical path throughout the next decade. They were one of the few soul groups of the era to write their own songs and to integrate horns and Latin rhythms into their gospel-based sound. Even more radical was the Impressions' - sometimes subversive, often overt - black-pride message. Though daring, this mix of pop music and politics worked for the group, which had 14 Top 40 hits in the '60s.

Five years later, Funny or Die, which McKay, Ferrell and "Entourage"executive producer Chris Henchy founded on a whim (and with the friendly urging of a venture capital firm), is way beyond baby steps. You might say, to keep the metaphor going, it already has graduated and become a media mogul: This fall there will be four Funny or Die-branded TV shows, two Web series and a movie in production, said CEO Dick Glover. It recently launched an iPad magazine, announced a deal to provide some of the in-flight entertainment for Virgin Airlines and started a commercial division. It's become the place where stars and corporations alike go to seem a little subversive. "The Landlord," the most-watched video in FoD history, has been viewed more than 80 million times, and the site gets 17 million visitors a month. Glover, who said Funny or Die became profitable in late 2010, has not ruled out the possibility ("someday, just not right now") of an initial public offering for Funny or Die stock.
This is just another artificial stimulus at our expense. If the president had allowed the housing market to bottom out naturally, it would have already happened a long time ago, and we'd be rebounding.

The custom led to a little-noticed but farcical episode in July 2003, when Communications Director Dan Bartlett held a White House briefing to defend the now-discredited national intelligence estimate of October 2002, which claimed Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. Throughout, the transcript refers to Bartlett as a "senior administration official," and news stories on the briefing duly credited a "senior administration official" or "White House officials." Four days later, Bartlett held another briefing on the same topic, in which he referred to several matters "I talked about last Friday." Inadvertently or not, Bartlett thereby revealed he was the same faceless official who had presided over the earlier briefing.

For Day 102, I did a treadmill while watching a few of the latter innings of the Indians' game. I jogged for eight minutes -- the first time I have jogged in two-plus months. A strained muscle in my back, then a pulled quad, kept me on the sideline. Thanks largely to the amazing work of massotherapist Karen Chorba, I have made tremendous progress on both fronts. I cannot imagine where I would be without Karen, whom I have known for years and who has helped expedite my healing from more than a couple of injuries.

Under the plea deal described in the media reports, Urdangarin would agree to plead guilty on condition prosecutors not seek a jail term of more than two years. The length of any sentence is key because first-time offenders in Spain - Urdangarin has no criminal record - who are convicted of a crime and sentenced to two years or less automatically receive a suspended sentence.

To minimize the temptation for employers to wait until a worker has been out of work for six months, we should make the amount the federal government will provide proportionate to the amount of time the employee has been out of work, sliding from, say, 10 percent of salary for an employee out of work at just six months up to the maximum of 50 percent at, say, a year out of work.

I don't know about all of that. I need to be convinced that if the tournament expands to 96 teams why the first weekend of the tournament will still be as fascinating as it is now. My greatest fear is that if the NCAA isn't carefully monitored the added weekend of games will be nothing more than a glorified elimination tournament of the mid-majors or an excuse to continue to dump even more power-conference teams into the field no matter how lousy their regular-season records might be.
Even so, the sight of Rose going down late in Saturday’s 103-91 victory sent a major chill through Chicago and stirred a debate over whether he should have been in the game at that point.

Sean Durkin: I had the idea of making a film about a cult, but I wanted it to be a contemporary and local group. I didn't want anything too huge. Then I started looking at areas and upstate New York, and I could see it happening in the Catskills. I could imagine a group of people moving to a farm and starting this thing, and then where does it grow from there?

"A question I have is what reforms are being carried out that need 35 people," Wisniewski said. "It’s like the makings of a joke: ‘What has 70 legs and stand on both sides of the (Hudson) river? People hired at the Port Authority to implement reforms.’"
I tried subterfuge.
If you're traveling in a country with questionable water, keep in mind that you have to avoid exposure to local water in all of its forms. That means no ice cubes (other than in high-end hotels that promise use of bottled water in their ice-making), brushing your teeth with bottled water, and avoiding taking in any water when you shower. Yes, it's often a fuss, but a bad bout of diarrhea is much more of a fuss.
The 2010 movie isn't as good as the book, and some people didn't think much of the book in the first place. But it's hard to fault the beautiful scenes of Rome and its eye for food from the "Eat" ("no carb left behind") portion of the movie about a woman's search for identity and true love.

Tough to reflect right now."
In Castor & Pollux's case, Connolly said it kept its investment under wraps for competitive reasons.
Oskar's world starts off as a very narrow one. There is his working mom, with Bullock effectively dimming her normal bright light to play Oskar's not always likable mom, and John Goodman's insult-trading doorman offering some comic relief. The boy's main confidant, at least initially, is his grandmother. Played by veteran stage actress Zoe Caldwell ("The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"), she lives in the facing apartment building, ideal for walkie-talkie conversations late at night when Oskar's worries escalate. Her apartment also houses the mysterious Renter (Max von Sydow), who will figure into Oskar's life in significant ways.
Scutari asked why legislators should consider him an independent when he had spent more than a decade as a Republican.
For a taste of that past, check out Earnestine and Hazel's (531 S. Main St.; 901-523-9754). This Memphis mainstay was once a brothel and a shady after-show hangout for musicians.

In contrast, in our off-work hours, my friends and I wore bell-bottom jeans, decorated with Indian-print bedspreads and played the music of Dylan and Joan Baez. We wore our skirts very short or very long. We had grown up in one world, and now found ourselves in another.

With the way Hamels has pitched and the Braves have hit lately, that 2-0 lead in the fourth did not look easily surmountable.

According to some Web noodling: Even sold as a single fryer, the chicken is probably worth $2 a pound. Figure you get half its weight in sellable meat and the butcher would charge for $5,000. Recycled steel fetches 13 cents a pound on a good day, so $650 for that route.
May 1 is International Workers Day, a holiday embraced in Europe, but not so much here.

The latest chapter emerged in the last few years: a full-service movement that aims to make barbecue more routine than Chicagoans are used to.

As much as anything else in the movie, this cautionary lecture evoked the era when the Stooges reigned at kiddie matinees and low-rent TV stations. "Warning — kids!" we were always being told. "Don't try this yourself!" Solemn stories were told about the kid who shot his eye out with a BB gun, or ate a lot of Kool-Aid powder and then drank an RC Cola and his stomach exploded. As nearly as I can recall, nobody was hit over the head with a sledgehammer.

The right plan can artfully incorporate more furnishings than you might expect. Smaller scaled bedroom sets and efficient storage are key to keeping the space feeling uncluttered and welcoming. Anything that serves more than one purpose – such as an end-of-bed storage bench or a bedside table that has several drawers – is especially welcome. A small room tends to draw more attention to displays of collectibles, so create small groupings of your favorite things and use them to draw the eye to certain areas of the room. Keep in mind that you can increase the sense of spaciousness by choosing closed, streamlined storage. Tables, beds and chairs that sit high off the floor make rooms appear airier and less cluttered.

Matthew Davis tells us he doesn’t care what you think about the records he likes. But don’t judge him on that — judge him by what he’s willing to spin at parties. On the ambitious “Last Glittering Thrill,” he hands us a playlist, singing about the old Three O’Clock and Plasticland records on his turntable. Those bands made sharply written psychedelic guitar-pop — immersive, urgent, occasionally murky and pleasantly skewed. He’s chased — and captured — those virtues himself on “Believe in Sound,” the debut album by his latest outfit, the Thousand Pities. A longtime Garden State resident who now lives in Montclair, Davis has made some talented friends in Jersey pop: Stanley Demeski of the Feelies plays percussion on the brief “From the Air,” Deena Shoshkes of the Cucumbers sings harmony on the engrossing “Point Pleasant.” Davis’ regular band is awfully impressive, too, especially powerhouse drummer Ken Meyer and synth player Billy Donohue, who adds twinkle and purr to the occasionally downcast material. As for Davis himself, he possesses an emotionally resonant, weather-beaten voice that he puts to good use on ballads “Super-High Moon” and “Gone to Stay.” One of the best local releases of 2011 so far? Heck, forget about “local.”
Securing credit from a commercial lender can be a challenge for any farmer. It's especially challenging for new producers, who lack a long business history, and for farmers and ranchers with less conventional business models. That includes those selling to local stores, restaurants, and institutions or directly to consumers – Oregon's local food producers.
Dicecapades: Outnumbered (Haywire, $26; 3-6 players; age 12+; 30 min.) A promising idea for a light, fast-moving trivia game that founders on the reefs of poor follow-through. Each player rolls 10 dice, then competes with others to answer questions whose answers are all numbers; the trick is that you're eligible to answer only if all the digits in your answer are represented among your dice. Unfortunately, nearly all the questions are either too easy (quarts in a gallon) or too hard (languages spoken worldwide) to be any fun. And some are pure dada, like "Q: Paul Revere's ride? A: 12."

Beyond that, however, no additional Harford highway improvements have been funded past the conceptual stage, and the state has actually pushed back consideration of adding additional travel lanes on I-95 north of Route 24 in Abingdon. Harford County elected officials believe the interstate highway needs to be widened to a uniform width through the county, with a new interchange built at I-95 and Route 22, the latter being the main route into APG for people who work on post. Also long unresolved is the widening of Route 22 from Aberdeen to Route 543 east of Bel Air, the main route from the interior of the county to Aberdeen.
It apparently is unhip to have a staircase with risers. Risers are the boards the toe hits when a foot goes too far on the step. Minimalist steps seemingly float in air (and handrails are optional). I climb such stairs with great care, mindful of a friend whose leg slipped through. He snapped a quadriceps and spent two months in rehab. He was not a hipster, it is true.

When a ballplayer starts the season 0-for-12, his first hit is not just a breakthrough, but an unburdening.
To anyone with a functioning memory, however, this whining is implausible. So are the dire predictions that the president will somehow offend voters by claiming credit for whacking bin Laden (or by smacking Romney). During the Bush presidency, Republicans used precisely the same approach and worse, over and over, without fretting whether their words and ads were "divisive."
Take memory. Thirty-year-olds forget lots of things, but they don't blame dementia. Older people jump to the conclusion that memory failures are part of their inevitable decline, when in fact it could be that their values change about what's meaningful enough to remember, Langer said.

So why not bring up Mike Trout, just as they did Peter Bourjos, give him the Bobby Abreu at-bats so he can experience more big league pitching sooner and at the same time provide more speed in the outfield and on the bases? Wouldn't that impact the club? Or is waiting three weeks for each Abreu RBI a better idea?

A lot of people, if asked to pick their favorite Van Morrison album, would go with 1968's "Astral Weeks."

I left Iraq last summer after covering the conflict there for two years as a Los Angeles Times correspondent. There's a lot not to miss: the carnage, the ubiquitous sense of menace, the logistical barriers of reporting a story in a place where foreign journalists are shut out from much of Iraqi society. But there is also a deep sense of regret for having left behind so many Iraqi colleagues and friends, people who repeatedly risked their lives for me and others. Most have no chance to leave. It is hard to avoid feeling that I abandoned them, though none ever puts it that way.

Illinois is an object lesson in why firms are starting to pay more attention to the long-term fiscal prospects of communities. Early last year, the state imposed $7 billion in new taxes on residents and business, pledging to use the money to eliminate its deficit and pay down a backlog of unpaid bills (to Medicaid providers, state vendors and delayed tax refunds to businesses).

Now, my family is spread out around the country -- and the chocolates don't travel well. So I created a cookie version of the confection to capture similar flavors. The cookie base has a slightly chewy, brownie-like texture, with a crackling chocolate top. Since cherries are not in season, dried cherries are coarsely chopped and studded throughout the batter. The recipe calls for extra chocolate chunks that ooze from the baked cookies; they add a level of intensity that can easily be omitted.

Industry experts say there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the port of Norfolk. They say it has excellent facilities, as well as railroad connections that Baltimore and other ports can only envy.

Credit for the boulevard's promising start goes to the design concept, which is a collaboration between Jacobs Macdonald: Cityworks and city staff led by the Department of Public Works.

Louisville has trouble generating points but has won of late with a stingy 2-3 zone defense that likes to funnel traffic inside toward center Gorgui Dieng, who averages more than three blocks a game.

So it was a darn big deal with the Jaguars brought home the Class 1A boys' basketball title over the weekend, a thrill that will linger a little bit longer on the main streets of those central Minnesota cities than, probably, in Osseo, where winning the Class 4A title is much more of a school thing.

If you can read only one book, however, it should be "Titanic: First Accounts" (Penguin), in which editor Tim Maltin gathers classic inquiries and early testimonies from survivors. It is a stunning record of firsthand stories and early reports. "The ship was gradually turning on her nose — just like a duck does that goes down for a dive," recalls radio operator Harold S. Bride. "I had only one thing on my mind — to get away from the suction." The book is full of such accounts, as chilling to read today as the North Atlantic waters were on that fateful night.

Controlling your PC or Mac remotely becomes a completely different thing on the new iPad. The Retina display has greater resolution than many laptops, even. When you run an iPad VNC client (like Screens or iTeleport), the experience is very close to that of having a fully-functional -- albeit slightly slow -- desktop computer in front of you. Even when you're connecting back to your desktop computer via an LTE connection, it's quite a credible experience. There's no need to scrunch the screen down to give yourself enough working room, and you don't need to zoom in to make things legible and useful.
"A dance teacher who was laid off would not come back because a mathematics teacher retired," said John Crowe, superintendent of the Woodbridge school district, where about 25 percent of certified staff was eligible to retire.
Duckworth was a starter on two NBA Finals teams with the Blazers, reaching that pinnacle through hard work and self-motivation. Duckworth attended Thornridge High School, a basketball power outside of Chicago, and did not make the basketball team his freshman year because he missed school the day of tryouts.

The Charlotte Observer, the state's largest newspaper, voiced opposition to the amendment: "North Carolina already bans same-sex marriage by state law so this constitutional change is unnecessary.

I'm beginning to suspect that the Oval Office teleprompter may be malfunctioning, or that perhaps that NBC News producer who "accidentally" edited George Zimmerman into sounding like a racist has now edited the smartest president of all time into sounding like an idiot. Either way, it appears the last seven words fell off the end of the sentence. What the president meant to say was:
In a related issue, Niehaus said that a new congressional map that cleared the House last week could be brought to the Senate floor for a vote this afternoon.

We had dinner at the Crossroads Café in Joshua Tree, a casual, friendly hangout with healthy sandwiches and beer on tap. Ian was welcome here and offered milk with Ghirardelli chocolate. Afterward, I played a little guitar on the cabin's porch without, from what I could tell, waking the neighbors, and we went to sleep. So far, I thought, looking up at the startlingly bright desert stars, so good.
Christie, a Republican, campaigned for GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Brady, who lost the election to Democrat Pat Quinn.

"True Blood" (9 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 29, HBO): With only two more episodes left in the cable drama's don't-blink third season, a seriously disturbed Russell (Denis O'Hare) seems poised for one royal showdown with Eric (Alexander Skarsgard) and, well, just about everybody. Is that why Eric took Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) prisoner at the end of last week's episode -- as bait to lure Russell into a confrontation?

This band from Stillwater, Okla., follows the map drawn by its honky-tonk forebears: driving fiddle, and touring the well-worn Red Dirt route through Arkansas, Texas and New Mexico. But lead songwriter Evan Felker also calls up contemporary images, such as the soldier writing a letter "beneath a big Afghan moon" in "Southeastern Son," and a vivid car crash in "Before the Devil Knows We're Dead."

Agatha Christie was not cozy. She earned the title the Queen of Crime the old-fashioned way — by killing off a lot of people. Although never graphic or gratuitous, she was breathtakingly ruthless. Children, old folks, newlyweds, starlets, ballerinas — no one is safe in a Christie tale. In "Hallowe'en Party," she drowns a young girl in a tub set up for bobbing apples and, many chapters later, sends Poirot in at the very last minute to prevent a grisly infanticide. In "The ABC Murders," she sets up one of the first detective-taunting serial killers.

But the real reason to not legalize pot is that we can't afford it. Anti-pot legislation and enforcement are the cornerstones of our whole incarceration system, which is the largest in the world. Legalizing pot would immediately throw millions of Americans out of work: judges, lawyers, prosecutors, policemen, security guards, bail bondsmen, court reporters, prison guards, parole officers, prison construction personnel, prison commissary operators, media people, not to mention farmers, harvesters, marketers and transportation folk (should we talk about where all those people shop, buy homes, take vacations, etc?).

- Fox 10 Sports anchor Jude LaCava tweeted that former Broncos coach and current Rams offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels has interest in the ASU job. I couldn't confirm this (McDaniels' agent did not immediately return a message) but it seems a dangerous path for ASU to go down.

It would seem reasonable to wonder how long he'd stay committed to a college program.

That's a notable thing about Joshua Tree National Park and the towns around it. While legions of Californians keep their faces to the beach, no matter the season, a certain stripe of traveler is powerless to resist the desert, especially in cooler months. They come for the wide-open spaces and quirky lodgings you see in the park-adjacent towns of Joshua Tree and 29 Palms. They come for the bands at Pappy & Harriet's, for the steaming pools of lithium-rich water at Desert Hot Springs or maybe for a sound bath (to be explained soon) at the Integratron in Landers.

The factors that have separated the teams have been minimal, namely the Blues' power play (or, depending how you view things, San Jose's penalty-killing) and their goaltending. Brian Elliott stopped 24 of 25 shots in Game 4, some spectacularly, while the Blues have scored on six of 16 power plays. It will behoove San Jose not to take any silly penalties.

Greg Couch, FoxSports.com: "The Self image has more than evolved in the past few years, it has transformed. Bill Self used to be a TV-ready salesman with a nice smile, a warm handshake and a friendly little drawl. If he meets you today, he will remember two years later what you were wearing, and ask about specific family members. He could land great recruits, but then couldn't win big with them. It was a classic coaching category: Great recruiter, can't coach. Now, he is a coaching guru, a genius. Did Self change, or was it just his image? Is it just the way we label coaches and athletes, everything so black and white? This is fact: Self has lost early in the NCAA tournament with great teams. The title he won? Five of his players were selected in the next NBA Draft. Who can't win a college title with a pro team? Whatever, this much is also true: This Kansas team is not loaded. The one time Self's recruiting let him down, he has had to rely on his own wits and skills."

Knowledge of the menu is another concern. Ordering cocktails, I ask my waiter what's in the Gravedigger ($8.75), as the description lists nothing beyond a floater of 160-proof rum.

Holding meetings standing up isn't new. Some military leaders did it during World War I, according to Allen Bluedorn, a business professor at the University of Missouri.

Dear Margo: I work for a small company on a team of four women in their late 20s. There's a problem with one of my colleagues that might strike you as odd. "Mary" suffers from severe PMS. Several days before the onset of her menses, she turns into a nightmare. Moreover, she gets a leave of absence for a couple of days each month because she feels ill when she has her period. I'm not a freak who makes another lady's cycle her business, but after working so closely for two years, you just notice such things. In the first months of working together, I sympathized, but it's getting to be too much now. She's not the easiest person to begin with, but during the week prior to her period, she becomes intolerable. I am getting fed up covering her workload when she is out. I gently suggested she consult a doctor. Her answer boils down to "no use seeing a doctor, that's the way I was born." I brought this up to our boss, who told me he is aware of the behavior but is reluctant to let her go because of her knowledge of our company, which is true. Also, he is reluctant to deal with the whole subject. Should I start looking for another job? Should I start nagging our boss? — Feeling Stuck

In Luke chapter 8, we have the Parable of the Sower recorded (verses 4-8). Later in this chapter after Christ is asked about the parable, He explains it (verses 11-18). What is important is that Christ said the 'seed" is God's word. You see, even when we think we have failed as a Christian spouse, parent, teacher or leader of a congregation, as long as we live the faith, teach the faith and abide in the faith, we have planted the seed: the word of God (Luke 8:11-18; Gal 2:20; John 15:10; James 1:22-27).

Meanwhile, some observers have criticized the paper for unmasking lawmiss, and there is some merit to that. It's wrong to offer anonymity, then yank it away.

As NFL offenses have evolved, the role of the fullback -- Jim Brown's position, for heaven's sake -- has been relegated to pure blocker. A series of rules changes since 1974 have made it harder for defensive backs to cover receivers while also providing more protection for quarterbacks.

For adults, there is artistry and allusions aplenty even in Hans Zimmer's score (surely someone will come up with a trivia game to cover the countless film references woven into nearly every scene). There is giggle-inducing slapstick, high-stakes showdowns and even a moral to this story for the kids. All of which combine to create an Old West that is downright good old-fashioned entertaining.
On the outskirts of the city, Tommy and Andy are the first team to discover the next Detour, which is divided into "Grass Fed" or Rice "Field." In Rice Field, teams have to deliver lunch to a group of rice farmers and then plant 300 rice shoots in the mud. The Grass Fed challenge requires teams to fill two bags with grass, collect two lambs and then fill a trough with six buckets of water. Like most restaurants these days, the teams are heavily about Grass Fed, even though it may actually be the harder challenge, what with the sheep herding. As Tommy and Andy collect their grass and walk their sheep, Laurence and Zac, the father-and-son adventurers, soon catch up. However, Laurence and Zac fail to read their clue closely and inadvertently bend the rules using four buckets, when the clue indicates only two per team. Tommy (or Andy, it's hard to tell them apart) warns them to read their clue closely, but they ignore the advice.

The IRS doesn't usually ask for this level of information when deciding on a group's tax status, said the senators in a letter to IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman.

But in the last few years, pledges from the congregation haven't covered the annual budget. The church dipped into the endowment to meet operating expenses. Just last week, the church council decided to withdraw another $20,000 from the shrinking endowment to supplement next year's budget.

Powell, who holds an endowed chair in history at Tulane University, has written in "The Accidental City" what should stand for years as the definitive history of New Orleans' first century, the period that he regards as central to the city's formation and its character.

The Obama administration sued to block the Arizona law soon after its enactment two years ago. Federal courts have refused to let four key provisions take effect: requiring police, while enforcing other laws, to question a person's immigration status if officers suspect he is in the country illegally; requiring all immigrants to obtain or carry immigration registration papers; making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job and allowing police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants.

DeCastro, as many scouts have already noted, may be one of the meanest offensive linemen to come out of college in a long time.

This is because the dog learned at an early age that laying in its own feces or that of another dog is normal. It’s not. If you have a dog purchased from a pet store it was raised in a puppy mill.
